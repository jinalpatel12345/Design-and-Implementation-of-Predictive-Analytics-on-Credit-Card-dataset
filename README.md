# Design-and-Implementation-of-Predictive-Analytics-on-Credit-Card-dataset
Design and Implementation of Predictive Analytics on Credit Card dataset using SAS Enterprise Miner


The goal of this project is to develop and build the necessary components of a data pipeline for predictive modelling on the credit card dataset. The dataset concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values. There are also a few missing values.
SAS Enterprise Miner has been used to perform all the operations.
